# Day 1: Basics - Hello, World! üåç

## Objective
The goal for Day 1 was to set up the Rust environment and write a simple "Hello, World!" program to ensure everything is working correctly.

## What I Learned
- Installed Rust and verified the setup with `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`.
- Created a new Rust project using `cargo new` to quickly set up the project structure.
- Learned basic Rust syntax and how to run a program using `cargo run`.

## Code
Here‚Äôs the basic Rust code to print "Hello, World!" to the console:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
