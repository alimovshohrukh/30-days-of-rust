# 30 Days of Rust ü¶Ä

Welcome to my 30-day journey of learning Rust! This repository is a collection of daily coding challenges and projects, aimed at building up my Rust programming skills, from basics to advanced concepts. Each day, I‚Äôll tackle a new challenge, covering topics like Rust fundamentals, data structures, memory management, and more.

## Goals üéØ
- Strengthen my understanding of Rust programming concepts.
- Build confidence with Rust's unique features like ownership and memory safety.
- Document progress and reflect on each day's learning experience.

## Structure üìÅ
Each day has its own folder (`day01`, `day02`, etc.), containing:
- **main.rs** - the Rust code for that day's challenge.
- **Cargo.toml** - the manifest file for Rust's package manager, cargo
- **README.md** - a brief description of the task, insights, and notes.
